# Hologine, a study in high-performance game engine design
There's plenty of information on designing a high-perfomance game engine, but
little in the way of examples. Hologine is my attempt to develop a game that
would support many thousands of unique agents acting in real-time via efficient
usage of cache, memory, and threading.
